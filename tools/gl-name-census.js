// Which binaries in the corpus name a GL entry point the WAT mirror cannot
// reproduce?  `node tools/gl-name-census.js [path ...] [--families=a,b]
// [--list] [--json]`
//
// WHY THIS IS A STRING SEARCH AND NOT AN IMPORT WALK. Every GL engine we run
// resolves GL through GetProcAddress rather than the import table -- Quake II's
// QGL layer and GoldSrc both do -- so `tools/pe-imports.js ref_gl.dll` lists
// KERNEL32, USER32 and GDI32 and no OpenGL at all. The names are still in the
// file as literals, because that is what GetProcAddress is handed. So the
// strings are the only static evidence there is.
//
// WHAT A HIT MEANS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. A hit means the binary can reach
// that entry point. It does NOT mean it calls it on any route we run: Quake
// II's ref_gl.dll names glPushAttrib and a 40000-batch menu census counted
// zero calls to it. This is the same static-reach-versus-hotness distinction
// that tools/find-loops.js carries, and it cuts the same way -- use this to
// decide what MIGHT matter, and `test/run.js --gl-census` to find out what
// did.
//
// TWO KINDS OF HIT, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS EVIDENCE. A binary that
// IMPLEMENTS or LOADS the whole GL API names all of it by construction: the
// 3dfx/PowerVR MCDs (`3dfxgl.dll`, `pvrgl.dll`), and SDL, whose GL loader
// table is the same list in every DOSBox and ScummVM build in the corpus. A
// hit in one of those says nothing about any app. The hits that mean something
// are engine and game code -- Quake II's `ref_gl.dll`, whose QGL table is
// hand-written and lists only what the renderer actually uses, GoldSrc's
// `hw.dll`, the Unreal `opengldrv.dll`s, `IDDemo.exe`. Read the --list output
// and sort the rows yourself; the percentage alone is an upper bound.
//
// The point of the count is the mirror in src/09a8f-gl-matrix.wat, which
// latches UNTRUSTED on any family it cannot follow and then refuses to build
// a descriptor at all. A family named by one binary is a one-app problem; one
// named by most of them is a gate on the whole approach.
