7-Zip recognizes its WinZip self-extractor: 15 files, two directories,
85,622,092 uncompressed bytes. It contains `alice.exe`, `demo/cgamex86.dll`,
`demo/fgamex86.dll`, `demo/pak0.pk3`, and Miles sound drivers. The included
readme identifies the November 27, 2000 demo. No installer execution is needed
to obtain these original files.

No Alice/McGee registration, task, or gameplay run directory was found in the
current registry, TODOS, board, and retained run-name search. This is a queued
new-game candidate; no launch or gameplay is claimed. BW2 remains compatibility
coverage rather than being counted as another previously unqualified title.

Static import audit reports 212 imports in `alice.exe`, including five missing
API-table rows: `midiInStart`, `midiInOpen`, `midiInGetDevCapsA`,
`midiInGetNumDevs`, and `midiInClose`. Each gameplay DLL has 77 imports and no
missing/explicit fail-fast handler reported. Static imports do not establish
that these functions execute; do not add silent stubs based on this scan.
Dynamic OpenGL/Miles lookup and actual runtime behavior remain untested.

Preflight hashes, small extracted executables/readme, and import report:
`scratch/alice-preflight-20261009/`. Original archive transfer to temporary
`bx_75agndxm:/tmp/alice-original.exe` is in progress; `transfer.json` is the
authoritative completion/checksum receipt. No missing archive paths are known.
Next: verify transfer, extract on the boat, audit the complete DLL closure,
then launch through ordinary controls after the serialized BW2/Disciples II
runtime work. Do not start a parallel emulator or browser.
