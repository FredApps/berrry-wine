  ;; OpenGL matrix stacks, owned by WAT.
  ;;
  ;; GL's transform state is the one part of the fixed-function pipeline that
  ;; still lives only in JavaScript (lib/gl-compat.js:352-354), which is why
  ;; the command stream is a log of GL calls rather than a backend-neutral
  ;; descriptor: nothing on this side knows what the matrices are, so nothing
  ;; on this side can lower a draw. See docs/gl-software-path-design.md.
  ;;
  ;; This fragment is additive. It mirrors the JS semantics exactly rather than
  ;; improving on them, so the two can be compared element-for-element while
  ;; both exist; the encoder is wired to it separately. Every arithmetic choice
  ;; here is made to match lib/gl-compat.js:112-166 bit for bit:
  ;;   - matrices are COLUMN-MAJOR, 16 f32, as Float32Array is there;
  ;;   - products accumulate in f64 and are demoted once on store, because JS
  ;;     computes in doubles and stores into a Float32Array;
  ;;   - sin/cos come from the host imports, which are the same Math.sin/cos.
  ;; The one deliberate deviation is rotation's axis length: JS uses
  ;; Math.hypot, which is more accurate than sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z) and has no wasm
  ;; equivalent, so a rotation about a non-unit axis can differ in the last
  ;; ulp. Tests compare rotations with a tolerance for exactly this reason.

  ;; Per-context block, 10832 bytes:
  ;;   +0    matrix mode (0x1700 MODELVIEW, 0x1701 PROJECTION, 0x1702 TEXTURE)
  ;;   +4    active texture unit (0 or 1)
  ;;   +8    depth of stack 0 (modelview), index of its top entry
  ;;   +12   depth of stack 1 (projection)
  ;;   +16   depth of stack 2 (texture unit 0)
  ;;   +20   depth of stack 3 (texture unit 1)
  ;;   +24   sticky stack error: 0, GL_STACK_OVERFLOW or GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW
  ;;   +28   sticky UNTRUSTED flag: the opcode this block could not mirror
  ;;   +32   four stacks, 32 entries of 64 bytes each (8192 bytes)
  ;;   +8224 scratch used by a multiply whose destination aliases a source
  ;;   +8288 staging matrix a caller writes before load/mult (64 bytes)
  ;;   +8352 light model ambient, 4 f32
  ;;   +8368 eight lights, 64 bytes each: position, ambient, diffuse, specular
  ;;   +8880 material: ambient, diffuse, specular, emission (16 each),
  ;;         then shininess f32 at +8944, padding to +8960
  ;;   +8960 fog: mode i32, density f32, start f32, end f32, colour 4 f32
  ;;   +8992 scratch for a scalar setter that must present four f32
  ;;   +9008 viewport x, y, width, height (4 i32, as glViewport was given them)
  ;;   +9024 depth range near, far (2 f32, demoted from GL's GLclampd)
  ;;   +9032 depth of the attribute stack, the count of saved frames
  ;;   +9040 attribute stack, 16 frames of 112 bytes (1792 bytes)
  ;;         (ends at +10832)
  ;;
  ;; An attribute frame is: mask, active texture unit, light model ambient
  ;; (4 f32), material (the whole 80 bytes at +8880, shininess included).
  ;;
  ;; THAT SET IS SMALLER THAN REAL GL'S, DELIBERATELY. glPushAttrib with
  ;; GL_LIGHTING_BIT saves the light parameters too, and this saves neither
  ;; those nor fog nor the viewport -- because lib/gl-compat.js:709-720 does not
  ;; save them either, and the whole point of this fragment is that the two
  ;; agree element-for-element. Saving more here would make the WAT descriptor
  ;; and the WebGL picture disagree after a pop, which is a worse failure than
  ;; the one being mirrored: it appears only in scenes that push attributes, and
  ;; only as lighting that is subtly wrong in one backend. The gap is real and
  ;; belongs on both sides at once, not on one.
  ;;
  ;; The mask is recorded but not consulted on restore, again because the JS
  ;; does not consult it: it saves one set and restores that set whatever was
  ;; asked for. Kept in the frame because it is the first thing a future
  ;; mask-honest restore needs, and because a frame that does not carry it
  ;; cannot be checked against the call that made it.
  ;;
  ;; Viewport and depth range are here rather than with the rest of the GL
  ;; state in 09a8e because DFX1 wants them (+68..+88) and this is the block
  ;; the descriptor is built from. They are the only two fields in it that no
  ;; matrix or light operation touches.
  ;;
  ;; The depth cap is 32, which is GL's own required minimum for the modelview
  ;; stack. Real GL raises GL_STACK_OVERFLOW rather than growing, so a push
  ;; past the cap latches the error and leaves the stack alone. The JS mirror
  ;; has no cap and would keep pushing; nothing in the corpus nests that deep.

  ;; this cannot change what anything draws. That is the whole point of the
  ;; step -- the mirror has to be shown correct on real apps before anything
  ;; is allowed to depend on it.
  ;;
  ;; THE HONEST PART. One family of call moves this state and is not mirrored
  ;; here: glPushAttrib/glPopAttrib save and restore the lighting and material
  ;; state wholesale (lib/gl-compat.js:695-719), so following them means owning
  ;; a copy of the attribute stack rather than composing a matrix.
  ;; gluPerspective/gluLookAt/gluOrtho2D used to be in this list and are now
  ;; mirrored below, written as the compositions gl-compat performs so the two
  ;; cannot drift apart in the algebra. Rather than let the block drift
  ;; silently away from the truth, what is left latches the opcode into the
  ;; UNTRUSTED field at +28. A consumer must refuse to lower a draw from a
  ;; block whose UNTRUSTED field is nonzero; a test can assert it stayed zero
  ;; for a given app, which turns "we think we cover this app" into a measured
  ;; claim. Clearing it is deliberate and belongs to whoever implements the
  ;; missing family.

  ;; $gl_arg_words and $gl_is_barrier are generated against, and the same bare

  ;; array breaks every one of them together, which is why it is append-only

  ;; ---- DFX1, the transform half -------------------------------------------
  ;;
  ;; The first thing on this side that produces a backend-neutral descriptor
  ;; instead of consuming GL calls. It fills ONLY the fields this block owns:
  ;; magic, ABI, viewport, depth range and the three matrices. Flags, register
  ;; indices and every stage field stay zero, because they describe the vertex
  ;; data and the texture stages, which this block knows nothing about. A
  ;; caller completes those. Writing a guess for them would be worse than
  ;; leaving them out: a descriptor is read as authoritative, and a wrong flag
  ;; word draws confidently wrong instead of failing.
  ;;
  ;; Two conversions, both of which are mistakes waiting to happen:
  ;;
  ;; GL matrices are column-major (m[col*4+row]) and DFX1 is row-major, so
  ;; every matrix is TRANSPOSED on the way in. A transposed transform is still
  ;; a valid-looking transform -- it will render a scene, just the wrong one --
  ;; so nothing downstream can catch this, and the test checks a matrix whose
  ;; transpose differs from itself.
  ;;
  ;; GL's modelview goes to DFX1's WORLD slot and view is left identity. This
  ;; is not a free choice, and it is the opposite of what it first looks like.
  ;; Geometry cannot tell the two apart -- it uses the product -- and neither
  ;; can lighting's normal matrix, which inverse-transposes world*view
  ;; (09aj:299-300). The ONLY consumer of the view matrix alone is the DLT1
  ;; light direction (09aj:681-683), and GL has already transformed its light
  ;; positions into EYE space at glLightfv time (:429-434). A modelview parked
  ;; in view would therefore apply it to those a second time: the geometry
  ;; still lands correctly and every light is lit from the wrong place, which
  ;; is the hardest class of wrong picture to attribute. With view identity the
  ;; eye-space direction passes through untouched, which is exactly GL's rule
  ;; that a light is fixed in eye space once specified.
  ;;
  ;; What this does NOT reproduce is D3D's own rule, where a light is fixed in
  ;; WORLD space and re-transformed every draw. There is no split to recover:
  ;; GL has one modelview and does not say which part of it is the camera.
  ;; See docs/gl-software-path-design.md section 5.
  ;;
  ;; Returns 0 and writes nothing when the mirror is untrusted. That is the
  ;; whole point of the latch: a descriptor built from state we know we failed
  ;; to track is a confident wrong answer, and refusing is the only honest one.

  ;; Three things here are REFUSALS rather than omissions, because each one is
  ;; a case where a DLT1 exists that renders something, and the something is
  ;; not what GL would have drawn:
  ;;
  ;;   - A POSITIONAL light (GL_POSITION with w != 0). DLT1 rows carry a

  ;;     not 3 (09aj:644), so there is nowhere to put the position. Dropping
  ;;     the light instead would darken the scene silently.
  ;;   - A light whose SPECULAR term is not provably zero. DLT1's row has a
  ;;     diffuse and an ambient and no third colour, and the lowering
  ;;     accumulates exactly those two (09aj:688-691). GL's default light 0
  ;;     specular is white, so refusing on that alone would refuse almost
  ;;     every app; what is refused is a light whose specular can actually
  ;;     reach the picture, which needs the MATERIAL specular to be nonzero
  ;;     too. GL's default material specular is black, so an app that never
  ;;     asks for highlights gets an exact build.
  ;;   - More than 8 lights, or an UNTRUSTED mirror.
  ;;
  ;; Two conversions that are silent if wrong. GL's GL_POSITION with w == 0
  ;; points TOWARD the light; D3D's direction points away from it, and the
  ;; lowering negates what it reads (09aj:684), so the row carries the
  ;; NEGATED GL vector. And the direction is stored in eye space, which is
  ;; where GL put it at glLightfv time -- it survives the lowering's view
  ;; multiply only because $gl_dfx1_transform leaves view identity. The two
  ;; functions have to agree about that or every light moves.
  ;;
  ;; Not represented, and not detectable here: glColorMaterial. The three
  ;; source selectors are written 0 (from the material), which is GL's state
  ;; until an app turns colour material on, and 09a8e does not tell us when
  ;; it does. Nor is the material's shininess, which only a specular term
