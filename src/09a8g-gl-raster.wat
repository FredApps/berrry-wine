  ;; GL software rasterization -- lower WAT-native GL draws onto the D3DIM
  ;; rasterizer, with no JS anywhere in the path.
  ;;
  ;; WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE DSP1 PIPELINE.
  ;; docs/gl-software-path-design.md steps 3-5 route GL through the D3D9
  ;; software backend: assemble a DFX1, cascade it into a DSP1, hand that to
  ;; the shader VM.  Surveyed 2026-09-22 (write-up committed in that doc),
  ;; three of those pieces do not exist in WAT at all.  Nothing in WAT
  ;; consumes a DFX1 or a DLT1 -- $gl_dfx1_transform and $gl_dlt1_lighting are
  ;; test-only exports -- every descriptor the WAT rasterizer has ever seen was
  ;; assembled in JS by lib/d3d9-software-backend.js, and DSP1 wants raw BGRA
  ;; and f32 depth pointers that GL has no render target to supply.
  ;;
  ;; D3DIM already has all of that, driven straight from WAT with zero JS
  ;; crossings: $rasterize_triangle_textured samples a DxObject texture,
  ;; interpolates colour, Z and perspective-correct UVs, and does blending,
  ;; alpha test and depth test into a DxObject target; $d3d9_create_surface
  ;; hands those surfaces out.  A DxObject target is also what makes --png,
  ;; --dx-surfaces, --dx-slot and the browser present path see the frame, so
  ;; the "GL render target" the survey said did not exist is the surface
  ;; record D3DIM and D3D9 already share.  GL textures become ARGB8888
  ;; DxObject surfaces for the same reason.
  ;;
  ;; STATE.  The JS frontend keeps its own copy of GL state to answer the
  ;; guest's queries; this file keeps the part that decides pixels, fed by
  ;; $gl_sw_observe from the same encoder call site as the matrix mirror, so
  ;; the two cannot see different call streams.  glPushAttrib/glPopAttrib are
  ;; honoured per group for the fields kept here.
  ;;
  ;; CULLING FOLLOWS GL, NOT D3D.  GL_CULL_FACE is off by default; D3D's
  ;; default is D3DCULL_CCW, which 8b227b5c made this emulator honour.  So
  ;; this must NOT route through $d3dim_draw_tl_triangle_textured, whose
  ;; state comes from a D3D device's render-state block -- there is no D3D
  ;; device here.  It calls the rasterizer directly with GL's state.
  ;;
  ;; Primitives are clipped against the near and far planes; one wholly
  ;; outside either (or that a non-frustum projection leaves at w <= 0) is
  ;; dropped and counted in gl_sw_clipped. The side planes need no clip: the
  ;; rasterizer clips spans to the target and coordinates are saturated.
  ;;
  ;; Points and lines go through the same state, sampler, depth test and fog
  ;; as triangles, as spans handed straight to the D3DIM span writer: a point
  ;; is a glPointSize square, a line is walked along its major axis with its
  ;; last pixel left off and widened to glLineWidth across the minor one.
  ;; Antialiased (smooth) points and lines draw aliased.
  ;;
  ;; NOT DONE YET, each one visible rather than silent: texgen and the second
  ;; texture unit, and texture formats other than 8-bit RGBA/RGB/BGRA/
  ;; LUMINANCE/ALPHA/LUMINANCE_ALPHA (counted in gl_sw_tex_unsupported; such
  ;; a texture samples as white).
